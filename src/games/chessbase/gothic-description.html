<p>Ed Trice invented the game of Gothic Chess in the year 2000 after researching 80-square board configurations for two years.</p>

<p>His analysis was very thorough, deemed worthy enough to be published in ICGA Journal in June of 2004.</p>

<p>(See "80-Square Chess," International Computer Games Association Journal Vol. 27 No. 2 pp. 81-95, 2004)</p>

<p>Trice demonstrated that there are flaws present in Capablanca's Chess (circa 1925) which tried to remedy</p>
  
<p>issues with Henry Bird's Chess (circa 1874), and Bird may have been trying to fix aberrations with</p>
  
<p>Pietro Carrera's 80-square configuration dating back to 1617.</p>

<p>Trice determined that the Gothic Chess configuration, the only one with all of the pawns defended</p>

<p>from the starting position, is the one with the greatest symmetry, and is the most enjoyable setup to play.</p>
